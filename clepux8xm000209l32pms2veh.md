# Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality is a blend of virtual and real objects in our surroundings. To better understand this technology we need to know about Immersive Technology. What is immersive technology? This might be the query that strikes you. Immersive Technology is the technology where a user is taken into the virtual world or computer world. The immersive world is divided into three kinds, they are V.R(virtual reality), A.R(augmented reality), and M.R(mixed reality).

### **Past**

Virtual Reality, firstly the meaning of the word “virtual” is not real or not fact. So the name itself tells us that it’s an unreal thing. V.R. takes to the virtual world by creating computer-generated graphics. It’s completely a computer world. Where the processor makes every single object with great details. The roots of this technology were from the machine invented by Morton Heiling in the 1950s. His machine Sensorama is embedded with multiple senses like sight, sound, smell, and touch. Virtual reality allows the user an immersive experience where one can go around the world from the place he’s sitting. It’s a revolutionary technology used in many sectors for many uses.

### **Present**

Augmented Reality is similar to virtual reality but again there exist many differences between these two. Virtual reality is a computer world. We get immersed in the computer-generated world. While the Augmented reality is a combination of both the virtual and real world. Here real objects are combined with virtual objects. We can find virtual objects in our real world. So, Augmented reality connects the virtual and real world. This technology works similarly to the human brain. It creates 3D maps on real-world surfaces and objects similar to the human senses. And then creates virtual objects accordingly on the surface or beside the real-world objects. It uses cameras to perceive objects and surfaces similar to human eyes. It was invented in the 90s by U.S . Air Force for immersive training of pilots. Later it is used for various purposes and the virtual experience is better than virtual reality since there is a connection with the natural objects. It is being used in many segments of our day-to-day life and various departments like education, medical, and defense systems. few examples:

**Google maps** use augmented reality to overlay virtual routes on real road for navigation.

During **football and cricket matches**, A.R. is used to illustrate the pitch and player hits and directions.

The **IKEA app** uses this technology to find the perfect furniture for our place.

Games like **Pokemon go** use this technology.

Social media also uses A.R., **Snapchat filters** use this technology.

In the **Archaeological department**, for virtual construction of ruined structures.

### **Future**

Mixed reality is a step forward to Augmented reality, hence also termed A.R 2.0. Intel explains that it “provides the ability to have one foot (or hand) in the real world, and the other in an imaginary place.” regarding the M.R technology. This technology is in the initial stage of its development.
